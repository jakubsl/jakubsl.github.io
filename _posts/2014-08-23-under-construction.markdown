Just to clarify, this is website is still under construction. I'm slowly starting to move some of my projects from [jakubs.eu](http://jakubs.eu/), I'm moving my projects to Github and creating pages for them and I'm starting to think about the design I want for this site.
It's not going to be anything extravagant, I want something simple where I can write about design and development of both my work and personal projects and also share them with people.

I'm still getting my head around [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the way [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) work. It's a bit of a slow process, I've been quite busy with work but I'm getting there.

To give you bit of a sneak peak of what I'd like to write about in the near future, apart from moving my old projects a bit on the design, I'd like to start developing some games using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). I'm really into games development and this is an amazing javascript library enables you to create cool html5 games. I'd also like to create some short tutorials for fellow front-end developers, talking about how to get started with Git, setting up your website using Github Pages, using Terminal (or Windows command line, even though to be honest, that one is a real pain to use) for development and later on about using amazing front-end dev tools such as Yeoman, Bower or Grunt. I'm not an expert in any of those but writing about what I've just learned and trying to pass it on to others really helps me to better process the information. Perhaps it will be helpful to some of you as well.

Well, that's about it for this update, stay tuned.
