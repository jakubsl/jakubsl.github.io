I was just tidying up some of my old project folders and I stumbled upon a game I did as a school project a few years ago. It's made in Flash using AS3.

The highscore system probably doesn't work anymore because the database is most likely dead, but you can still enjoy the game itself: [Run, Santa, Run!](http://jakubslaby.net/projects/runsanta).

Merry Christmas to you all!
