For the past few days I've been working on a small game idea I've got. I wanted to make a tiny casual game that would be incredibly simple to play yet still quite challenging. I also wanted it to work well on phones because I could use the opportunity to learn how to create mobile apps out of html5 apps using [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/).

I tried to think of something that could combine the amazing minimalistic design from Dots with the challenge and difficulty provided by Super Hexagon.
Something that would have really simple controls but would require very quick reactions in order to succeed.

need to work on feedback for success failute
background music
timer
timer could make ui too crowded and destroy the minimalism
visual cue that time is running out?
increased difficulty add 3 different shapes
refactor code


You can play the very first working prototype of the game [here](http://jakubslaby.net/colors/) or you can view the project [github page](https://github.com/jakubsl/colors).
