The [Projects](http://jakubslaby.net/projects) page is now finally live and I'll slowly be adding some of my newer projects to it.
For now, I really recommend you to have a look at the [Arkanoidz project](http://jakubslaby.net/projects/arkanoidz), where I talk my research on casual games and creating casual game design guidelines which could help game developers and designers to create better gaming experiences.

That's about it for now, I'll be back with some more stuff soon.
