subtitle: Front End Developer with love for bacon.
---

I am a passionate Front End Developer with love for HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. I enjoy building user interfaces, creating playful interactions and optimising sites so they work in IE8(jokes). I am really into usability, user experience and the psychology behind human-computer interaction.

I have graduated with a BSc[Hons] in Interactive Media Design at [Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.napier.ac.uk/) and I am currently part of the [Phantom Team](http://phantom.land) in London.

Also, I am originally from Slovakia and I really enjoy coming back to my lovely hometown, Bratislava (/wave).
