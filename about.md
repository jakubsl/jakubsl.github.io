I am a very passionate Front-end Developer with love for HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the countless number of its libraries. I enjoy developing user interfaces and I am really into usability, user experience and the psychology behind human-computer interaction.

I've graduated with a BSc[Hons] in Interactive Media Design at [Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.napier.ac.uk/) and I'm currently working as a developer for [Phantom](http://phantom.land) in London.

Also, I am originally from Slovakia and I really enjoy coming back to my lovely hometown, Bratislava.
